== Using Micrometer Tracing Directly

In this section we will describe how to use the Micrometer Tracing API directly to create and report spans.

=== Micrometer Tracing Examples

Below you can see basic operations on a span. Please read the comments in the snippet for details.

Below you can see how to continue a span in a new thread, that was started in another thread.

Below you can see how to create a child span when explicitly knowing who the parent span is.

=== Micrometer Tracing Brave Setup

In this subsection we will set up Micrometer Tracing with Brave.

Below you can see how to create a Micrometer Tracing `Tracer` using Brave components that would send completed spans to Zipkin.

=== Micrometer Tracing OpenTelemetry Setup

In this subsection we will set up Micrometer Tracing with OpenTelemetry (OTel).

Below you can see how to create a Micrometer Tracing `Tracer` using OTel components that would send completed spans to Zipkin.

=== Micrometer Tracing Baggage API

Traces connect from service to service using header propagation. Besides trace identifiers, other properties (called `Baggage`) can also be passed along with the request.

Below you can find an example on how to use the Tracer API (version `1.0.x`) to create and extract baggage.

//                         Example for Tracing 1.0.x
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{include-java}/tracing/TracingApiTests.java[tags=baggage_api,indent=0]

Below you can find an example on how to use the Tracer API (version `1.1.x`) to create and extract baggage.

[source,java,subs=+attributes]

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//                         Example for Tracing 1.1.x
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: For Brave, remember to set up the `PropagationFactory` so that it contains the baggage fields that you will be using in your code. Check the example below for details.

=== Aspect Oriented Programming (starting from Micrometer Tracing 1.1.0)

IMPORTANT: This section is applicable from Micrometer Tracing 1.1.0.

Micrometer Tracing contains a `@NewSpan`, `@ContinueSpan` and `@SpanTag` annotations that frameworks can use to create or customize spans for either specific types of methods such as those serving web request endpoints or, more generally, to all methods.

WARNING: Micrometer's Spring Boot configuration does _not_ recognize these aspects on arbitrary methods.

An incubating AspectJ aspect is included. You can use it in your application either through compile/load time AspectJ weaving or through framework facilities that interpret AspectJ aspects and proxy targeted methods in some other way, such as Spring AOP. Here is a sample Spring AOP configuration:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]

include::{include-java}/tracing/TracingSpanAspectTests.java[tags=spring_config,indent=0]

Applying `SpanAspect` makes `@NewSpan` and `@ContinueSpan` usable on any arbitrary method in an AspectJ proxied instance, as the following example shows:
