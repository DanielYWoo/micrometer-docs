== Handler Configuration

// TODO: We need to separately document that Micrometer provides a TimerObservationHandler

For Micrometer Tracing to work with Micrometer, you need to add a tracing related `ObservationHandler`.
Check the example below for an example of adding and using a single, `DefaultTracingObservationHandler`.

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----

    // `tracer` is a Micrometer Tracing compliant Tracer. Micrometer Tracing supports
    // Brave and OpenTelemetry Tracers out of the box. You would need to set it up manually
    // or have it injected by a DI framework.
    MeterRegistry registry = new SimpleMeterRegistry();
    // We set up a single `ObservationHandler` in the `MeterRegistry` configuration
    registry.observationConfig()
        // we set up a handler that creates timers - it comes from Micrometer
        .observationHandler(new TimerObservationHandler(registry))
        // we set up a handler that creates spans - it comes from Micrometer Tracing
        .observationHandler(new DefaultTracingObservationHandler(tracer));

    // Creating and starting a new observation
    // Via the `DefaultTracingObservationHandler` that will create a new Span and start it
    Observation observation = Observation.start("my.operation", meterRegistry)
        .contextualName("This name is more readable - we can reuse it for e.g. spans")
        .lowCardinalityTag("this.tag", "will end up as a meter tag and a span tag")
        .highCardinalityTag("but.this.tag", "will end up as a span tag only");

	// Put the observation in scope
    // This will result in making the previously created Span, the current Span - it's in ThreadLocal
    try {
		observation.scoped(() -> {
            // Run your code that you want to measure - still the attached Span is the current one
            // This means that e.g. logging frameworks could inject to e.g. MDC tracing information
			yourCodeToMeasure();
		});
    } finally {
        // The corresponding Span will no longer be in ThreadLocal due to try-with-resources block (Observation.Scope is an AutoCloseable)
		// Stop the Observation
        // The corresponding Span will be stopped and reported to an external system
		observation.stop();
    }
-----

This will result in the following Micrometer Metrics:

```
Gathered the following metrics
	Meter with name <my.operation> and type <TIMER> has the following measurements
		<[
            Measurement{statistic='COUNT', value=1.0},
            Measurement{statistic='TOTAL_TIME', value=1.011949454},
            Measurement{statistic='MAX', value=1.011949454}
        ]>
		and has the following tags <[tag(this.tag=will end up as a meter tag and a span tag)]>
```

And the following trace view in e.g. Zipkin

=== Ordered Handler Configuration

Micrometer Tracing comes with multiple `ObservationHandler` implementations.
To introduce ordering, you can use the `ObservationHandler.AllMatchingCompositeObservationHandler` to run logic for all `ObservationHandler` that are matching the given predicate and `ObservationHandler.FirstMatchingCompositeObservationHandler` to run logic only for the first `ObservationHandler` that matches the predicate.
The former can group or handlers and the latter can be chosen to e.g. run only one matching `TracingObservationHandler`.
